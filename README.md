# Mini-Games

* LimuTyper - speed typing game where the player types along with a text and is rewarded for accuracy and speed, with trackers for both % accuracy and WPM
* Hangman - the player guesses letters to complete an insurance term before the stickman is created (5 lives). The hint given is a definition of the term itself.
* The other three games are not yet implemented but are viable ideas for future extensions of this idea.
